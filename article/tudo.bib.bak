  Abstract                 = {We give a worst-case analysis for two greedy heuristics for the integer programming problem minimize cx, Ax â¥ b, 0 â¤ x â¤ u, x integer, where the entries in A, b, and c are all nonnegative. The first heuristic is for the case where the entries in A and b are integral, the second only assumes the rows are scaled so that the smallest nonzero entry is at least 1. In both cases we compare the ratio of the value of the greedy solution to that of the integer optimal. The error bound grows logarithmically in the maximum column sum of A for both heuristics.},

  Abstract                 = {An efficient and relatively fast algorithm for the detection of communities in complex networks is introduced. The method exploits spectral properties of the graph Laplacian matrix combined with hierarchical clustering techniques, and includes a procedure for maximizing the 'modularity' of the output. Its performance is compared with that of other existing methods, as applied to different well-known instances of complex networks with a community structure, both computer generated and from the real world. Our results are, in all the cases tested, at least as good as the best ones obtained with any other methods, and faster in most of the cases than methods providing similar quality results. This converts the algorithm into a valuable computational tool for detecting and analysing communities and modular structures in complex networks.},

  Abstract                 = {{David Goldberg's Genetic Algorithms in Search, Optimization and Machine Learning is by far the bestselling introduction to genetic algorithms. Goldberg is one of the preeminent researchers in the field--he has published over 100 research articles on genetic algorithms and is a student of John Holland, the father of genetic algorithms--and his deep understanding of the material shines through. The book contains a complete listing of a simple genetic algorithm in Pascal, which C programmers can easily understand. The book covers all of the important topics in the field, including crossover, mutation, classifier systems, and fitness scaling, giving a novice with a computer science background enough information to implement a genetic algorithm and describe genetic algorithms to a friend.}},

  Abstract                 = {The Handbook of Graph Theory is the most comprehensive single-source guide to graph theory ever published. Best-selling authors Jonathan Gross and Jay Yellen assembled an outstanding team of experts to contribute overviews of more than 50 of the most significant topics in graph theory-including those related to algorithmic and optimization approaches as well as "pure" graph theory. They then carefully edited the compilation to produce a unified, authoritative work ideal for ready reference. Designed and edited with non- experts in mind, the Handbook of Graph Theory makes information easy to find and easy to understand. The treatment of each topic includes lists of essential definitions and facts accompanied by examples, tables, remarks, and in some areas, conjectures and open problems. Each section contains a glossary of terms relevant to that topic and an extensive bibliography of references that collectively form an extensive guide to the primary research literature. The applications of graph theory are fast becoming ubiquitous. Whether your primary area of interest lies in mathematics, computer science, engineering, or operations research, this handbook holds the key to unlocking graph theory's intricacies, applications, and potential.},

  Abstract                 = {As a discipline, phylogenetics is becoming transformed by a flood of molecular data. These data allow broad questions to be asked about the history of life, but also present difficult statistical and computational problems. Bayesian inference of phylogeny brings a new perspective to a number of outstanding issues in evolutionary biology, including the analysis of large phylogenetic trees and complex evolutionary models and the detection of the footprint of natural selection in DNA sequences.},

  Abstract                 = {Linkage-learning (LL) was proposed as a methodology to enable {GAs} to solve complex optimization problems more effectively. Its main idea relies on a reductionist assumption, from which some optimization problems would be composed of interacting substructures that could be exploited to improve the {GA}'s search mechanism. In general, {LL}-{GA}s have been compared in a restricted set of well-known optimization problems, in which the reductionist assumption holds true, and just a few studies have concerned their performances in broader scenarios. To help to fill this gap we have compared four different {LL}-{GAs} in the classic Multidimensional-Knapsack Problems{MKP}, using for this all the instances provided by Chu~\&~Beasley (1998). Our objective was to verify if the relative performance of algorithms as: the {ECGA}, the {BOA} with decision graphs, the {BOA} with community detection, the {LTGA} and a simple {GA}; would remain the same in the {MKP}'s instances, where the existence of substructures is unknown. However, the results have shown the opposite, and algorithms as the {BOA} variants have only found similar solutions to those found by the {ECGA} and {LTGA} when using large population sizes.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose and study a set of algorithms for discovering community structure in networksânatural divisions of network nodes into densely connected subgroups. Our algorithms all share two definitive features: first, they involve iterative removal of edges from the network to split it into communities, the edges removed being identified using any one of a number of possible â? betweennessâ? measures, and second, these measures are, crucially, recalculated after each removal. We also propose a measure for the strength of the community structure found by our algorithms, which gives us an objective metric for choosing the number of communities into which a network should be divided. We demonstrate that our algorithms are highly effective at discovering community structure in both computer-generated and real-world network data, and show how they can be used to shed light on the sometimes dauntingly complex structure of networked systems.},

In particular, we consider algorithms which estimate h from the code lengths produced by some compression algorithm. Our interest is in describing their convergence with sequence length, assuming no limits for the space and time complexities of the compression algorithms. A scaling law is proposed for extrapolation from finite sample lengths. This is applied to sequences of dynamical systems in non-trivial chaotic regimes, a 1-D cellular automaton, and to written English texts. (c)1996 American Institute of Physics.},

Such organisms consist of a hierarchy of components, such that, at any level of the hierarchy, the rates of interaction within components at that level are much higher than the rates of interaction between different components. Systems with this property are called nearly completely decomposable, or more briefly, nearly decomposable (ND). The explanation for the ubiquity of the ND property is that, under the usual conditions of mutation and/or crossover and natural selection, ND systems will increase in fitness, and therefore reproduce, at a much faster rate than systems that do not possess the ND property.},

  Abstract                 = {Community structure is common in various real-world networks; methods or algorithms for detecting such communities in complex networks have attracted great attention in recent years. We introduced a different adaptive clustering algorithm capable of extracting modules from complex networks with considerable accuracy and robustness. In this approach, each node in a network acts as an autonomous agent demonstrating flocking behavior where vertices always travel toward their preferable neighboring groups. An optimal modular structure can emerge from a collection of these active nodes during a self-organization process where vertices constantly regroup. In addition, we show that our algorithm appears advantageous over other competing methods (e.g., the Newman-fast algorithm) through intensive evaluation. The applications in three real-world networks demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm to find communities that are parallel with the appropriate organization in reality.},
